Customizing Answer Feedback
The Feedback tab allows you to customize the messages and GIFs that users see after they answer a question.

The page is divided into two sections:

Correct Answer Feedback: The content shown when a user answers correctly.

Incorrect Answer Feedback: The content shown when a user answers incorrectly.

In each section, you can add or remove randomized Messages and GIF URLs to personalize the learning experience.
