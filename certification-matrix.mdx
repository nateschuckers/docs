Using the Certification Matrix
The Certification Matrix provides a high-level, interactive dashboard for monitoring company-wide training and compliance.

At-a-Glance Panels
At the top of the page, two panels highlight critical information:

Users Needing Attention: This panel automatically lists any user who has an overdue course or a course that is due soon, allowing for proactive follow-up. You can click the "Remind" button to open an email to that user.

Top Course Failures: This panel lists the courses with the highest total number of failures across all users. This helps you identify potentially difficult or unclear training material.

All Users Matrix
The main table provides a comprehensive overview of all users.

Sorting: You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers, such as Employee Name, Avg Completion, or Status.

Expanding a Row: Click anywhere on a user's row to expand it and reveal the User Detail Drawer. A chevron icon indicates if the row is open or closed.

User Detail Drawer: When expanded, this view shows a detailed breakdown of the user's assigned paths and courses, including the status and due date for each one.

Re-issuing Courses and Paths
From the expanded User Detail Drawer, you can re-issue content.

Purpose: Re-issuing a course or an entire path will reset the user's progress (status, attempts, etc.) and allow you to set a new due date. This is useful for annual recertification requirements.

How to Re-issue: Click the "Re-issue" link next to a course or the "Re-issue Path" link at the top of a path section. A confirmation window will appear where you must set a new due date to confirm the action.
