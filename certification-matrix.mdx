### At-a-Glance Panels

Two panels at the top of the page highlight critical information:

- **Users Needing Attention**: This panel automatically lists any user who has an overdue course or a course that is due soon. You can click the **"Remind"** button to open a pre-filled email to that user [cite: `CertificationMatrixTab.js`].
- **Top Course Failures**: This panel lists the courses with the highest total number of failures. This helps you identify potentially difficult or unclear training material [cite: `CertificationMatrixTab.js`].

### All Users Matrix

The main table provides a comprehensive overview of all users.

- **Sorting**: You can sort the table by clicking on column headers like **Employee Name**, **Avg Completion**, or **Status** [cite: `CertificationMatrixTab.js`].
- **User Detail Drawer**: Click anywhere on a user's row to expand it. This detailed view shows a breakdown of the user's assigned paths and courses, including the status and due date for each one.
- **Re-issuing Content**: From the expanded view, you can click the **"Re-issue"** link next to a course or path. This action resets a user's progress and allows you to set a new due date, which is perfect for annual recertification [cite: `ReissueModal.js`].
