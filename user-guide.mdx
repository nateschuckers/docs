### Getting Started: The Onboarding Tour

When you first log in, you'll be greeted with a welcome tour that quickly walks you through the key features of your dashboard. This tour will introduce you to:

- **Your Dashboard**: The central hub for all your courses and certification paths.
- **Taking Quizzes**: How to complete courses by passing a quiz with randomized questions.
- **Tracking Progress**: Where to find your stats, achievements, and company rank.

You can revisit this tour anytime by clicking the **user icon** in the top right, then selecting **"Show Tour"** from the **Profile Menu** [cite: `ProfileMenu.js`, `OnboardingModal.js`].

### Navigating Your Dashboard

Your dashboard is your home base, giving you a complete overview of your learning journey [cite: `UserDashboard.js`].

#### Certification Paths

Your assigned courses are organized into **Certification Paths**. Each path displays:

- An icon and a name (e.g., "Core Compliance Training").
- Your completion progress, shown as a percentage bar and a count of completed courses (e.g., "1/3 Courses Completed").

#### Course Cards

Within each path, you'll find individual **Course Cards**. Each card shows:

- The course title.
- Your current status, such as **"Not Started," "In Progress," "Failed,"** or **"Completed"**.
- The **due date** for the course, if applicable [cite: `CourseCard.js`].

#### Your Stats & Achievements

On the right side of your dashboard, you can track your overall progress:

- **Your Stats**: See your total number of courses passed and failed, as well as your total training time.
- **Your Achievements**: Collect "Course Badges" for every course you pass. Once you complete all courses in a path, you'll earn a special "Completed Track" achievement card [cite: `CompletedTrackCard.js`].
- **Leaderboard**: See how you rank against your colleagues based on the number of courses completed.

### Taking a Course

When you're ready to start learning, follow these steps.

#### 1. Starting a Course

To begin, simply click on any **Course Card** from your dashboard. This will take you directly to the **Question View** where the quiz begins. A passing score of **80%** is required to complete the course [cite: `QuestionView.js`].

#### 2. Answering Questions

For each question, you will be presented with a set of multiple-choice answers.

- Select the answer you believe is correct.
- Once you click an answer, it will be locked in. The correct answer will be highlighted in green, and an incorrect choice will be highlighted in red.
- A feedback window will appear with a message and a GIF. Click **"Next Question"** to proceed [cite: `AnswerFeedbackModal.js`].

#### 3. Completing a Course

After the final question, you will be taken to the **Completion Screen** [cite: `CompletionScreen.js`].

- **If You Pass**: Congratulations! A confetti animation will play, and you'll see your final score. Click **"Back to Courses"** to return to your dashboard.
- **If You Fail**: Don't worry! You'll see your score and have the option to try again. You can either click **"Retry Course"** to immediately restart the quiz or **"Back to Courses"** to return to your dashboard.

#### 4. Exiting a Course

If you need to leave a quiz before it's finished, click the **"‚Üê Back to Courses"** link at the top of the Question View. A confirmation window will appear to warn you that your progress on the current attempt will be lost. Click **"Exit Course"** to confirm and return to the dashboard [cite: `ConfirmExitModal.js`].
