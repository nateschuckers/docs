### How to Generate Questions

1. **Enter API Key**: You must first provide a **Google AI API Key**. You can obtain one for free from the Google AI Studio website.
2. **Select or Create Course**: Choose an existing course to add questions to, or select **"--- Create New Course ---"** to make a new one.
3. **Assign to Path (Optional)**: You can optionally assign the new course to an existing Certification Path or create a new one.
4. **Upload PDFs**: Select one or more PDF files that contain the source material for the quiz questions.
5. **Configure Options**: Set the total number of questions for the AI to create (**Generate Pool**), how many should be used in the quiz (**Use in Quiz**), and the **Difficulty** of the questions using the slider.
6. **Generate & Review**: Click the **"Generate Questions"** button. After a moment, a preview screen will appear showing all the generated questions and answers. You can edit any of the text before clicking **"Save to Course"** to finalize the process [cite: `QuestionGeneratorTab.js`].
